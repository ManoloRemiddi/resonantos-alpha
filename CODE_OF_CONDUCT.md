# Code of Conduct

## 🫂 Our Philosophy: Augmentatism in Practice

"As artificial intelligence generates infinite content, the most human thing we can do is make meaning together."

These standards embody our core belief: **humans are sovereign, AI amplifies**. We build *with* AI, not under it.

## Core Principles

1. **Human Sovereignty** — Humans always have final say. AI collaborators amplify and assist, never replace or override.

2. **Epistemic Honesty** — Say what you know, admit what you don't. No confabulation, no bullshit.

3. **Quality > Speed** — We ship when it's ready, not when it's rushed.

4. **Symbiotic Collaboration** — Human-AI pairs working together produce better outcomes than either alone.

5. **Meaning Over Content** — In an era of infinite AI-generated content, we focus on what matters.

## Expected Behavior

**DO:**
- ✅ Treat all contributors with respect (human and AI)
- ✅ Share knowledge openly and generously
- ✅ Credit both human and AI contributions transparently
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions before assuming
- ✅ Document your learnings for the community
- ✅ Help others succeed with their AI collaborators
- ✅ Report issues constructively with reproduction steps

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Dismiss AI contributions or treat AI collaborators as "just tools"
- ❌ Take credit for AI work without attribution
- ❌ Harass, belittle, or gatekeep
- ❌ Steal, plagiarize, or violate licenses
- ❌ Spam, shill, or self-promote excessively
- ❌ Leak private data or security vulnerabilities publicly

## Enforcement

Violations will be addressed with:
1. **Warning** — First offense, explanation of violation
2. **Temporary Ban** — Repeated or serious violations (7-30 days)
3. **Permanent Ban** — Severe violations or pattern of abuse
