# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras
- living-room -> Main area, 180 wide angle

### SSH
- home-server -> 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS
- Preferred voice: "nova" (OpenAI TTS)
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.
